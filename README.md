# Anti-Hate-dashboard
Spring 2024 AI final project

## Introduction
Living in a world where everybody creates and consumes a large amount of content, our mental health grows increasingly more attached to responses from the internet. 
As an example, on platforms such as youtube, content creators can recieve all kinds of responses, including comments containing hateful, toxic messages, which can severely impact a person’s mental health. 
Also to be noted, the degree of “hatefulness” one can accept differs for each individual, and we believe in giving people the choice of the  content they consume.
Therefore as an effort to provide a personalized content moderation method, we aim to build a customizable comment filter, hoping to improve the internet browsing experience from a personal angle.
